TODO: 

New issues: 
    - database missed rookies
    - during rfa back and forth, set current bidder to 0
    
    - add current status to all toasts (bids and years)
    
    - Add bye to all screens
    - add some stats to players
    - bold team currently winning the auction
    - some sort of confirmation on what happened last round
    - ability to drop out early - dont show everyone else
    - allow draft history for admins with no teams
    - remove pass and drop out of player selection from admin screen

    x REMOVE CONFIRMATION STEP FROM SELECTION
    - unknown bug (see note 5)
    - add a "you are up in X picks"
        - return next X teams in order
    - add ability to pin searched players so they are always on your search screen
    - add a view roster button to see someone's roster
        - summary of how many of each player type they have
        - something special for your team info on your screen
    - weird bug where it skipped #8 after a no bid rfa
    X no bid rfa goes to owner to match when it should go to bid winner to raise
        - added toast, doesnt work on refresh, text entry doesnt show up, not linked correctly
    X does draft history not update between rounds? 
    - names into table next ot team name
    - updating rfas not working for some reason (set to update on refresh all?)
    - clicking update rfas caused a bid to end to 0 
    - rfas not getting removed somehow 
    x added flashy bits for RFA selection
    - add a last drafted player
    - search results not vertically centered 



Last years TODO:

    X RFA – when no one bids on a player offered up the system needs to handle that cleaner (have the owner just “confirm the $1 win)
    - Add time reporting for each section of the draft (the Rookie draft took x minutes, and the RFA was XX minutes….)
    - Clean up the pop up boxes so they stop popping after you have acknowledged them
    - Build in a roster count for each team showing where they are in relation to the 26 Player limit.
    - Add the list of players drafted and on rosters  as the draft goes on  (we may need to look at how this can work)
    - Change the color for “Out of Bid”  to make it more noticeable (like Red)
    - Need to update the status of a player that and owner pre-selects, so if that player is drafted before the owners turn, they can’t put up the same play for bidding a second time.
    X Submit Button should be disabled for player selection until it is that Owner’s turn. (can pre-select but not submit players till it is time) 
    - Need to add the ability for teams to trade rookie draft picks  (hopefully before and during the draft)    
    - add ability to quickly control users
    - add player details to rfa match_1, raise, match 2 toasts
    - check for TODOs in code
    - show all rfas and disable ones already selected
