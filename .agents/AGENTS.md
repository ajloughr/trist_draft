# Workspace Behavioral & Workflow Rules

## Player Selection Rules
- **Tabbed Interface**: The Player Selection card in UFA and Rookie drafts uses Bootstrap nav tabs (`#tab_search_db` and `#tab_manual_entry`) to separate database search from manual entry.
- **Search Direct Confirmation**: Selecting a player from the search database results table (`+` button) directly triggers the modal confirmation (`#select_player_confirmation_modal`). It skips manual entry.
- **Manual Player Entry**: To nominate an unlisted player, users switch to the "Manual Entry" tab (`#tab_manual_entry`), fill in player details, and click Submit (`#submit_selected_player`).

## Draft Admin Panel Rules
- **Dedicated Admin Route**: Draft administration is managed at `/draft-admin` (accessible to staff users).
- **Hidden Legacy Controls**: The legacy inline admin card on `/auction` is hidden (`#old_admin_panel_container`).
- **Clean Admin Navbar**: User-level navbar toggles (Help Mode, Bathroom Mode, Draft History) are hidden when on `/draft-admin`.
